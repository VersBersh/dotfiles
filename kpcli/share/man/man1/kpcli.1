.SH "NAME"
kpcli \- A command line interface to KeePass database files.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A command line interface (interactive shell) to work with KeePass
database files (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass).  This
program was inspired by my use of \*(L"kedpm \-c\*(R" combined with my need
to migrate to KeePass. The curious can read about the Ked Password
Manager at http://kedpm.sourceforge.net/.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
Please run the program and type \*(L"help\*(R" to learn how to use it.
Run the program with \-\-help as a command line option to learn about
its command line options.
.SH "PREREQUISITES"
.IX Header "PREREQUISITES"
This program requires these non-core modules:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Crypt::Rijndael\*(C'\fR \- libcrypt-rijndael-perl on Ubuntu 10.04
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadKey\*(C'\fR   \- libterm-readkey-perl on Ubuntu 10.04
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Sort::Naturally\*(C'\fR \- libsort-naturally-perl on Ubuntu 10.04
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`File::KeePass\*(C'\fR   \- libfile-keepass-perl on Ubuntu 12.04
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Term::ShellUI\*(C'\fR   \- libterm-shellui-perl on Ubuntu 12.10
.PP
It is recommended that you install \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Gnu\*(C'\fR which will
provide more fluid signal handling on Unix-like systems, making kpcli
robust to suspend, resume, and interrupt \- \s-1SIGSTP, SIGCONT\s0 and \s-1SIGINT.\s0
That module is in the libterm-readline-gnu-perl package on Ubuntu.
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Perl5\*(C'\fR, which is often
preferred on platforms without \s-1GNU\s0 readline (MacOS, Windows, etc.)
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Clipboard\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Tiny::Capture\*(C'\fR to use the
clipboard features; http://search.cpan.org/~king/Clipboard/ and
libcapture-tiny-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Sub::Install\*(C'\fR to use the \-\-timeout feature.
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Data::Password\*(C'\fR to use the pwck feature
(Password Quality Check); libdata-password-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Data::Password::passwdqc\*(C'\fR, which is preferred
by the pwck feature if it is available. That module is not commonly
packaged and its list of dependencies is quite long, but cpanminus installs
it nicely on Linux Mint. It appeared that all of its upstream dependencies
were packaged in Linux Mint and so I apt-get install'ed them first, and
then cpanminus only installed \f(CW\*(C`Data::Password::passwdqc\*(C'\fR. Because it is a
binding to a C library, \f(CW\*(C`Data::Password::passwdqc\*(C'\fR is much faster than
\&\f(CW\*(C`Data::Password\*(C'\fR and also seems to have a bit more stict password rules.
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::PWSafe3\*(C'\fR in order to import
Password Safe v3 files (https://pwsafe.org/). The dependency list
of this module is hefty and it is not packaged in many distros, but
cpanminus installs it nicely on Linux Mint (https://cpanmin.us/).
.PP
You can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Math::Random::ISAAC\*(C'\fR in order to use a
more secure \fIrand()\fR function. Package libmath-random-isaac-perl on Debian.
.PP
On \s-1MS\s0 Windows, you can optionally install \f(CW\*(C`Win32::Console::ANSI\*(C'\fR to get
\&\s-1ANSI\s0 colors in Windows cmd terminals. Strawberry Perl 5.16.2 was used
for the kpcli port to Windows and, using cpanminus, one can install all
of kpcli's dependencies, sans Term::ReadLine::Gnu which is optional for
kpcli and not supported on \s-1MS\s0 Windows.
.SH "CAVEATS AND WORDS OF CAUTION"
.IX Header "CAVEATS AND WORDS OF CAUTION"
The main author of kpcli primarily interoperability tests with KeePassX
(http://www.keepassx.org/) and primarily uses KeePass v1 (*.kdb) files.
Support for KeePass v2 (*.kdbx) files in kpcli is substantial, and many
people use it daily, but it is not the author's primary use case. It is
also the author's intent to maintain compatibility with v1 files, and so
anyone sending patches, for consideration for inclusion in future kpcli
versions, is asked to validate them with both v1 and v2 files.
.SS "Some versions of Term::ReadLine::Perl5 are incompatible"
.IX Subsection "Some versions of Term::ReadLine::Perl5 are incompatible"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Perl5\*(C'\fR versions 1.39\-1.42 are incompatible with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Term::ShellUI\*(C'\fR module, which is core to kpcli. There is information about
this in kpcli \s-1SF\s0 bug #18 (http://sourceforge.net/p/kpcli/bugs/18/). The
\&\f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Perl5\*(C'\fR author submitted a \f(CW\*(C`Term::ShellUI\*(C'\fR patch to
resolve the issue (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105375) and
he also released \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Perl5\*(C'\fR version 1.43 which resolves it.
.SS "No history tracking for KeePass 2 (*.kdbx) files"
.IX Subsection "No history tracking for KeePass 2 (*.kdbx) files"
Recording entries' history in KeePass 2 files is not implemented. History
that exists in a file is not destroyed, but results of entry changes made
in kpcli are not recorded into their history. Prior-to-change copies are
stored into the \*(L"Recycle Bin.\*(R" Note that File::KeePass does not encrypt
passwords of history entries in \s-1RAM,\s0 like it does for current entries.
This is a small security risk that can, in theory, allow privileged users
to steal your passwords from \s-1RAM,\s0 from entry history.
.SS "File::KeePass bug prior to version 2.03"
.IX Subsection "File::KeePass bug prior to version 2.03"
Prior to version 2.03, File::KeePass had a bug related to some \*(L"unknown\*(R"
data that KeePassX stores in group records. For File::KeePass < v2.03,
kpcli deletes those unknown data when saving. Research in the libkpass
(http://libkpass.sourceforge.net/) source code revealed that what early
versions of File::KeePass classifies as \*(L"unknown\*(R" are the times for
created/modified/accessed/expires as well as \*(L"flags\*(R" (id=9), but only for
groups; File::KeePass handled those fields just fine for entries.  I found
no ill-effect from dropping those fields when saving and so that is what
kpcli does to work around the File::KeePass bug, if kpcli is using
File::KeePass < v2.03.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
.SS "Using Ctrl-D to Exit"
.IX Subsection "Using Ctrl-D to Exit"
Versions of Term::ShellUI prior to v0.9. do not have the ability to trap
Ctrl-D exits by the client program. I submitted a patch to remedy that and
it made it into Term::ShellUI v0.9. Please upgrade if kpcli asks you to.
.SS "Multiple Entries or Groups With the Same Name in the Same Group"
.IX Subsection "Multiple Entries or Groups With the Same Name in the Same Group"
This program does not support multiple entries in the same group having
the exact same name, nor does it support multiple groups at the same
level having the same name, and it likely never will. KeepassX does
support those.  This program detects and alert when an opened database
file has those issues, but it does not refuse to save (overwrite) a file
that is opened like that. Saves are actually safe (no data loss) as long
as the user has not touched one of the duplicately-named items.
.SH "AUTHOR"

Special thanks to Paul Seamons, author of \f(CW\*(C`File::KeePass\*(C'\fR, and to
Scott Bronson, author of \f(CW\*(C`Term::ShellUI\*(C'\fR. Without those two modules
this program would not have been practical for me to author.
